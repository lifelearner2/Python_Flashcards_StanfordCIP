"""
Python Flashcard game to help students learn and test their knowledge on beginning Python.
If an answer is correct, the user will be congratulated and will see a Hello Kitty image on the canvas. 

This program is a graphics program that draws colored rectangles for the flashcards and draws a hello kitty image
as visual feedback when an answer is correct. It uses a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a
flashcard question and answer as the key/value pair. It utilizes a for loop as well as if/else statements.

There are also several helper functions related to hello kitty drawing.
